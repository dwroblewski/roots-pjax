Roots PJAX

> WordPress meets HTML5 Boilerplate, Bootstrap, and PJAX

Roots PJAX extends the [Roots](http://www.rootstheme.com/) WordPress theme to add PJAX to HTML5 Boilerplate and Bootstrap from Twitter.

Roots PJAX makes asynchronous layouts in WordPress a reality, which combined with the existing components of Roots, is a powerful and full featured starting point for your next WordPress project.

PJAX "loads html from your server into the current page without a full page load. It's AJAX with real permalinks, page titles, and a working back button that fully degrades." Browsing just "feels faster" and makes mixing and matching static and dynamic site elements a breeze. By default, PJAX loads content asynchronously within the `#wrap` div, providing load once static functionality to the header and the footer.

##Getting Started

1. [Install](https://github.com/retlehs/roots/#quick-start) and activate Roots
2. [Download] and extract Roots PJAX in the WordPress `themes` folder.
3. Add [custom functionality](https://github.com/wayoutmind/roots-pjax/blob/master/functions.php#L10-11) in `functions.php` and [style to taste](https://github.com/wayoutmind/roots-pjax/blob/master/style.css) within `style.css`.
4. Activate the Roots PJAX theme in the WordPress Dashboard.
